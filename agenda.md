| 3:20 PM                                      | Reorganize into 2 main groups to tackle specific “toy” problems. Each group should contain a good mixture of experimentalists / empiricists, process modelers, and statisticians / programmers. Each group should have identified at least one toy data set, and at least 2-3 models that could be fit to the data set(s). |
