## Ways to contribute

1. [edit this page](https://github.com/soil-metamodel/soil-metamodel.github.com/edit/master/contributing.md)
1. If your project doesn't have one, [create a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) (provided by [Github for education](https://education.github.com/)).
2. Add meeting and other notes to the project [wiki](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/), [README](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#commit-your-first-change)
3. Text and code that might ultimately be included in a manuscript (or not) can be added to an  or [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file
4. Add data to the [decomposition_datasets](https://github.com/soil-metamodel/decomposition_datasets) repository
5. Specific tasks / discussions can be added to the 'issues' list associated with each project (e.g. here: https://github.com/soil-metamodel/back-forth-mm/issues)
 * This is also a good place for project-specific questions / discussions
 * a nice way to view issues is here: https://huboard.com/soil-metamodel/back-forth-mm/



## Using Github

1. create a github account (https://github.com/join)
2. edit anything you want by clicking the edit / pencil icon
3. fork and clone the repository
4. ask questions, suggest changes, manuscripts, proposals as a new [github 'issue'](https://github.com/soil-metamodel/soil-metamodel.github.com/issues/new).

### Within Github

It is pretty easy to make edits directly (e.g. try attempting to edit one of the files here (e.g. [Introduction.md]( https://github.com/dlebauer/ecological-forecasting-workflows-draft/edit/master/Introduction.md#fullscreen_blob_contents) after you have an account). It should walk you through the steps of suggesting an edit via pull request.

See the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository)

### Desktop

Use your favorite IDE! or click "Clone in Desktop" button on the right side of this page.

e.g. [this link for Windows](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/dlebauer/soil_metamodel) that uses [Github for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)


### Formatting Equations (Latex + GitHub ?@&*!)

For the latex experts: github won't parse Latex equations, but you have options: 
 1. if you want it to be in the documentation, you can embed images or generate HTML code that will be parsed (here: http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php) 
 2. Latex equations won't be parsed on Github, but will be parsed if you run an Rmarkdown file using Rstudio or knitr.
