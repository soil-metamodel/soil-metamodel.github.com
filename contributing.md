## Ways to contribute

1. [edit this page](https://github.com/soil-metamodel/soil-metamodel.github.com/edit/master/contributing.md)
1. If your project doesn't have one, [create a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) (provided by [Github for education](https://education.github.com/)).
2. Add meeting and other notes to the project [wiki](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/), [README](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#commit-your-first-change)
3. Text and code that might ultimately be included in a manuscript (or not) can be added to an  or [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file
4. Add data to the [decomposition_datasets](https://github.com/soil-metamodel/decomposition_datasets) repository
5. Specific tasks / discussions can be added to the 'issues' list associated with each project (e.g. here: https://github.com/soil-metamodel/back-forth-mm/issues)
 * This is also a good place for project-specific questions / discussions
 * a nice way to view issues is here: https://huboard.com/soil-metamodel/back-forth-mm/

### Licensing

To create a license for your writing / data, see http://creativecommons.org/choose/. It will create both text and html code that can be embedded into a README file or other markdown document to specify if and how others may use/reuse the content created by you (e.g. unpublished data) or the group (e.g. code, writing). It is also possible to create private repositories / groups in GitHub (see below).

## Using Github

1. create a github account (https://github.com/join)
2. edit anything you want by clicking the edit / pencil icon
3. fork and clone the repository
4. ask questions, suggest changes, manuscripts, proposals as a new [github 'issue'](https://github.com/soil-metamodel/soil-metamodel.github.com/issues/new).

### Making changes

* It is easy to edits directly in the browser. See the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository)
* Try [Github for Windows](https://windows.github.com/), [Github for Mac](https://mac.github.com/), or [other GUIs](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
* For more advanced use:

 * [GitHub's list of resources](http://soil-metamodel.github.io/contributing.html)

### Formatting Equations (Latex + GitHub ?@&*!)

For the latex experts: github won't parse Latex equations, but you have options: 
 1. if you want it to be in the documentation, you can embed images or generate HTML code that will be parsed (here: http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php) 
 2. Latex equations won't be parsed on Github, but will be parsed if you run an Rmarkdown file using Rstudio or knitr.
