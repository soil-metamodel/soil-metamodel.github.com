### Organizers:

* Kiona Ogle (Arizona State University), 
* Jennifer Powers (University of Minnesota), 
* David LeBauer (University of Illinois)

### Workshop overview:

This workshop follows from discussions during the 2012 RCN FORECAST conference on “New perspectives on data assimilation in global change science.” At that meeting we recognized the need to integrate information from diverse methods that have been used to measure and model belowground processes. We proposed to build a ‘super model’ in which to combine different modeling approaches with heterogeneous data. 


### Expected Products and Outcomes: 

We are deliberately recruiting a diverse group with skills in modeling and/or empirical measurements of soil carbon, and we expect that participants could contribute to a number of different products including a conceptual or synthesis paper, model development and application, and/or the eventual submission of a grant proposal to further develop these activities.
